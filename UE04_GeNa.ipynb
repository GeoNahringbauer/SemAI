In this notebook you have to transform your solutions according to the workaround exemplified in V04_SPARQL_Update.ipynb\n","- After executing the update request, print a serizalization of the dataset in TriG format.  \n","\n","**Task 9 (2 points)**  is to develop a nice visualization of RDF datasets using `visualize_graph_pyvis` from UE02 as a starting point. The requirements are as follows:\n","- Each named graph must be represented as an independent graph. This means, for example, that :Jane in :JanesGraph is a different node than :Jane in :BillsGraph. There are no edges between nodes in different graphs.\n","- It is not strictly necessary to draw a box around each named graph, as seen in the slides. The different named graphs should simply be visually distinguishable and not overlap.\n","- If not all nodes within a named graph are connected, make sure in the visualization that the named graph still forms a coherent visual unit in some way."],"metadata":{"id":"HnpijZy2D1Hd"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Install required packages\n","!pip install -q rdflib     # comment to avoid re-install with every re-run\n","\n","# Imports\n","import pandas as pd\n","import rdflib\n","from rdflib import Graph, Literal, RDF, URIRef, BNode, Namespace\n","\n","\n","# Convenient Functions\n","def sparql_select(graph,query,use_prefixes=True):\n","  results = graph.query(query)          # execute the query against the graph, resulting in a rdflib.plugins.sparql.processor.SPARQLResult\n","  rows = []                             # a list of dictionaries, as intermediate format to construct the pandas DataFrame\n","  for result in results:                # iterate over the result set of the query, a result is an instance of rdflib.query.ResultRow\n","    row = {}                            #     create a dictionary to hold a single row of the result\n","    for var in results.vars:            #     iterate over the variables of the SPARQLResult to add a dictionary entry for each variable\n","      if (isinstance(result[var],URIRef) and use_prefixes):\n","        row[var] = result[var].n3(graph.namespace_manager)   # use namespace prefixes to shorten URIs\n","      else:\n","        row[var] = result[var]                  \n","    rows.append(row)                    #     add the dictionary (row) to the list \n","  return pd.DataFrame(rows,columns=results.vars)        \n","                                        # return a pandas DataFrame constructed from the list of dictionaries, with the variables from the result set as"],"metadata":{"id":"1BafA7cQmui4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681896884212,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":4346,"user":{"displayName":"Georg Nahringbauer","userId":"08531559333068486936"}}},"execution_count":48,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Task 1\n","Sie beginnen mit einem leeren Dataset.
